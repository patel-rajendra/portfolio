# Acceptance Criteria
- Presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
- Click one of the links in the navigation then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- The application's image should be larger in size than the others
- Click on the images of the applications then deployed application should be open
- The site should be responsive layout that adapts to mobile & tablet view.

# Additional requirements:
- Ensure all links are functioning correctly
- Clean up the CSS to make it efficient
  - Consolidate CSS selectors and properties
  - Organize them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements
  - Include comments before each element or section of the page
